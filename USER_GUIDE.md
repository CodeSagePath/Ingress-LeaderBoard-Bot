## ❓ Common Questions

### "Bot says: Not ALL TIME stats"
Make sure you're copying **ALL TIME** stats, not monthly or weekly stats. The first column should say "ALL TIME".

### "Bot says: Invalid faction"
Your faction in the stats must be exactly "Enlightened" or "Resistance" (case-sensitive).

### "Bot says: This doesn't look like Ingress stats"
Make sure you copied the complete stats text including the header row. It should start with "Time Span Agent Name Agent Faction...".

### "How often should I submit?"
Submit as often as you like! Many agents submit:
- ✅ Daily (for accurate progress tracking)
- ✅ After major playing sessions
- ✅ At least weekly (to appear on weekly leaderboards)

### "Can I see other agents' stats?"
Yes! Use `/leaderboard` to see the top agents in various categories. You'll see agent names and their stat values.

### "Can I delete my submissions?"
Contact your bot administrator if you need to remove incorrect submissions.
